<p id="description">The "English Subtitles for Video using OpenAI Whisper" project aims to automate the generation of high-quality English subtitles for video content using OpenAI's Whisper model. Whisper is a state-of-the-art speech recognition system capable of transcribing spoken language with high accuracy. This project leverages Whisperâ€™s powerful transcription capabilities to create precise and synchronized subtitles for videos improving accessibility and enhancing the viewing experience for audiences especially for those who are deaf or hard of hearing or for viewers who prefer subtitles. Key features of the project include: Automated Transcription: Whisper processes the audio track of a video transcribing spoken words into text with high accuracy. Subtitling Synchronization: The generated subtitles are time-coded ensuring they are perfectly aligned with the corresponding video frames. Multi-Format Support: The system supports various video file formats allowing flexible input and output options including popular subtitle formats like SRT and VTT. Language and Accent Handling: Whisper's model is robust across different English accents dialects and noisy environments making it versatile for diverse content. Customization: The project allows for basic subtitle customization such as font style size and position on the screen to ensure readability. User-Friendly Interface: The project includes a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload videos and download the subtitle files.</p>
